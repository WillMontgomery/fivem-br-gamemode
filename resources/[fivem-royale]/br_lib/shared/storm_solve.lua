-- Storm solver.
--
-- The single most important property here: this is a PURE FUNCTION of a record
-- the server published once, plus the current time. Server and client both call
-- it and both get the same answer, so a shrinking storm costs zero per-frame
-- network traffic. The server uses it to apply damage; the client uses it to draw
-- the wall. Neither one streams the radius to the other.
--
-- Load order: requires enums.lua and geo.lua.
